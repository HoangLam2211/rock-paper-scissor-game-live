# 🪨 📄 ✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game with Computer Vision

## 📝 Description
This project is a "Rock Paper Scissors" game that uses computer vision to recognize hand gestures from a player and compete against the computer. The application uses a pre-trained deep learning model to recognize hand gestures.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2) - For image processing from webcam
- TensorFlow/Keras - Deep learning model
- NASNetMobile - Neural network architecture
- Matplotlib - For displaying charts and images

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Place your hand inside the square frame on screen
2. Make one of these gestures:
   - ✊ (fist) - Rock
   - ✋ (open hand) - Paper
   - ✌️ (scissors) - Scissors
3. Computer will randomly select a move
4. Results will be displayed and scores calculated

## 📊 AI Model
- Added custom Dense and Dropout layers
- Trained with custom collected hand gesture data
- Achieves ~95% validation accuracy

## 📈 Results
The program displays:
- Player's and computer's moves
- Current scores
- Remaining attempts
- Final results when game ends
